// All cards that level up need to have the custom tag check on use for ffcopy
// so that they dont trigger on copy


// Change Luna to trigger when you play an attack not a skill?\
// Change it to Berzerk
// Check Anger Status


// Potion Item cards effects are doubled when you have the potion relic?
// Hows it work with no potion relic?
// Maybe just make them potions, or spawn the potion into the potion bar
// Since similar potions already exist, dont do, or rename them?

//this.setBackgroundTexture("expansioncontentResources/images/512/bg_boss_awakenedone.png", "expansioncontentResources/images/1024/bg_boss_awakenedone.png");
// Sets card background i think

// System.out.println("Monster Health after Damage: " + m.currentHealth);
// Can add this code to check int vaules that will print in the log

// Revoling; 6 shooter card. 50% chance for "gun jam" vs bullet.
// Can reolve 6 times. each doing 6 damage. final shot is more damage. Big bang
// upgrade is 25% or 33% chance to jam

// Anywhere i say enegery add a [E] or whatverit is

// add CardTags.HEALING to all cards that need it

// Some levelup spells seem to be missing the upgrade preview and special preview oversides and also
// is missing the ffcopy tag contigency

// Thief
// implements AlternateCardCostModifier

//!this.hasTag(FFCOPY)
// Reverse the has copy. give it copy by default and only remove it if if its via levelup.
// humm, then again the base spells wont level up cos they start with it...
// maybe add that as part of the copy code, that it ads the automtically within the card?

// add  if (!this.purgeOnUse) { to all lvel up cards
//

//        float dur = Settings.FAST_MODE ? 0.3f : 1.0f;
//        Timer.schedule(new Timer.Task() {
//@Override
//public void run() {
//        p.flipHorizontal = !AbstractDungeon.player.flipHorizontal;
//        AbstractDungeon.effectList.add(new TextAboveCreatureEffect(p.hb.cX, p.hb.cY, "Can't Escape!", Color.WHITE));
//        }
//        }, dur);

// Holy, maybe doubles current Regen?
// Or doubled temp hp? or bonus damage based on temp hp?
// or more damage if your near full hp?

// Flare. Doubles astral Fire before damaging.

// Astral Ice: add ice cracking sound, or ice orb sound when it triggers its effect
// Do the same for fire, but flame sound.

// Venom

// Strength and spells
// Check why strength down reduces magic damage

// Could have it overwrite when card spawns in hand?
